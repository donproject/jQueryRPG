Placeholder text styling from http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/style-placeholder-text/

I used this page for reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48239/getting-the-id-of-the-element-that-fired-an-event

Character and treasure clip art from google image searches. Resized by me.

Known bugs:
The game is pretty easy still.
Only tested on chrome on a mac, probably some CSS weirdness in other browsers/platforms.
I don't test the name input for anything other than existence, so I suppose it could break the script in some way.

Features I wanted:
Use the arrow keys to move.
Put a character in the dungeon instead of "You."
More complex fighting system.
More styling of drop down menus.
