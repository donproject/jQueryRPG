Placeholder text styling from:

I used this page for reference:

This page helped me fix a bug that was causing the run/fight events to happen multiple times:

Character and treasure clip art from google image searches. Resized by me.

Known bugs:
Only tested on chrome on a mac, probably some CSS weirdness in other browsers/platforms.
I don't test the name input for anything other than existence, so I suppose it could break the script in some way.
Footer doesn't show when you zoom real hard.

Features I wanted, but haven't completed (yet):
Use the arrow keys to move.
Put a character in the dungeon instead of "You."
More complex fighting system.
More styling of drop down menus (apparently not possible)
